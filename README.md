# ASP.NET Core Web API Using Entity Framework Core

## Overview

This project is a simple **RESTful web API** that demonstrates the use of object-relational mappers (ORMs) and Entity Framework Core (EF Core) using standard HTTP methods such as **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations from a relational database.

## Demonstrates

- ORM concepts
- EF Core architecture
- Interaction with a database by using EF Core
- EF Core migrations to keep the code and database in sync
- Reverse engineering to generate entity models from an existing database
- Seeding a database on app startup

### App can be tested using this Link: http://localhost:5200/swagger

This app uses Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to persist data to a database. Same skills can be applied to other EF Core database providers, like SQL Server and PostgreSQL.
